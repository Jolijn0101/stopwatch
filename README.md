## Description:

For my portfolio I made a stopwatch in javascript. It is really easy to use and has a number of functions.

start: starts the stopwatch
pause: pauses the stopwatch
stop: stops the stopwatch and clears the time at the same time
restart: clears the time and stars immediately
lap: saves the lap and displays it under the stopwatch
reset laps: clears all the saved laps
